# Singly Linked List
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. 

## Challenge
 Create a Insert method Take value as an argument then create a node to insert this node at the beginning of this list
 Create Function that check if the list contain a node with specific value and retrun True if founded 
 Create a Append method Take value as an argument then creat a node to append this node at the end of list
 Create a Insert Before  method Take value and New Value as an argument then creat a node to insert this node at the before specific value 
  Create a Insert after  method Take value and New Value as an argument then creat a node to insert this node at the after specific value 
 
 

## Approach & Efficiency
  takes method insert , check includes, convert to string ,append , Insert Before , Insert after
