# Singly Linked List
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. 

## Challenge
 Create a Insert method Take value as an argument then create a node to insert this node at the beginning of this list Create Function that check if the list contain a node with specific value and retrun True if founded 

## Approach & Efficiency
  takes method insert , check includes, convert to string
