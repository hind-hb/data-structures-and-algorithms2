## Merge Sort
 - Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
 - Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
 - Present a complete set of working tests

## Challenge
Merge sort works by splitting the input list into two halves, repeating the process on those halves, and finally merging the two sorted halves together.

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n.logn)
Because the list is being split in log(n) calls and the merging process takes linear time in each call.
Space: O(1)
This list is being sorted in place, keeping the space at constant O(1).
