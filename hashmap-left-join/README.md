# Code Challenge 33

## Hashmap Left Join
  
  
## Challenge Summary
  * Write a function called left join.
  
  * Arguments: two hash maps.
    - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
    - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
  
  * Return: The returned data structure that holds the results like that -> 
    - Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
    -  LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the “right” hashmap, they are appended to the result row.
    - If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row.
